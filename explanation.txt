What I've essentially understood is that we've created a chart based on the data retrieved from 'server3.py.' We've utilized this data to generate and present a data feed in a specific format for traders, enabling them to visualize it effectively for finding their optimal solution. Following this, we've defined 'Order' and 'ServerRespond' interfaces to provide information to 'DataManipulator.tsx.' This information is employed to calculate 'price_abc,' 'price_def,' the ratio, and other associated parameters. Subsequently, we export this data to 'Graph.tsx' to create the chart, and finally, we export it to 'App.tsx' for display purposes.
